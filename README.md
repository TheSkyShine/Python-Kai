# Python-Kai

Thank you for actually coming to the repository to try out our code!!!

Much thanks to Corey Schaffer since his tutorials helped me write some of the code.

You can run Messi_Stats.py just fine by importing matplotlib, pandas, and numpy. If not included in your IDE, please install them using pip.

The data_generator.py script imports csv, random, and time. Again, if not included in your IDE, install through pip. But, this script must be running at the same time as the Live_Plotter.py script since it contiously writes data into a .csv that Live_Plotter.py will read. Most IDEs have trouble running multiple scripts at the same time. Therefore, we recommend going to your terminal (or command line if you're a Windows noob like me), and running the data_generator.py script through there. Now you can run the Live_Plotter.py script no problem!

DISCLAIMER!!!!!
We did not write data_generator.py or Live_Plotter.py. That was all Corey Schafer through his amazing python tutorials on Youtube. God, Corey got me through this class. Corey if you're reading this, I love you.
